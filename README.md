# secretsapi

Here I have tried to fetch data from an api 
The website features new secrets with nicknames !
To run on localhost download the files install the required npm packages and uncover the hidden secrets:)

U can view the deployment at:
https://secretsapi-va4i.onrender.com/
PS: It takes some time to load!
